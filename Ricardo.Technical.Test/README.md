Scenario:
A website called Pen n’ Paper.com has just been given their first look at their new website. 
After a period of testing, they have come back with some additional features they would like.
We’ve gathered the following feedback:
-	The Shop needs to record its stock so that it doesn’t sell items it doesn’t have any more.
-	Customers have been asking to see their order history while they are logged in.
-	Customers should be able to sign out of the application.
-	Customers want to be able to remove things from their basket.


Application background:
The Pen n’ Paper website is a self-contained Blazor Server application that will not need to expose functionality to the web.
It is relatively basic, but features may need to be expanded upon in the future.
The app consists of the following features:
-	Log in as a customer.
-	Browse some items.
-	Add items to your basket.
-	Preview your purchase.
-	Place an order.

For this test:
Add the features the client has requested. You may also notice a few issues with the application, 
which you should address in a manner you feel is appropriate.
There is no time limit for completing this test.
You will need a copy of Visual Studio 2022 to run this application.
The username and password for the customer is "test" and 1234 respectively
